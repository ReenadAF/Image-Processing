# Image-Processing

# Project Description

This project is a Java desktop application built using Java Swing that demonstrates basic image processing techniques. The application allows the user to upload an image and display it in two panels. The first panel applies a pixel-based glitch effect that changes the image pixels manually each time the Step button is pressed. The second panel applies a multi-color animated filter, where the image colors continuously shift when the Start button is activated and stop when pressed again. To improve user experience, the program handles large images by resizing them and displays a loading message while image processing is in progress. This project focuses on understanding pixel manipulation, event-driven programming, and simple animation concepts in Java
